# Ascendance
OS-independent*, mass-deployable neovim configs.

Comes with some plugins. You can remove at any time.

Uses lazy.nvim package manager. OOTB supports for Markdown and Python.

<span style="font-size:4em;"> *A slight change is needed to provide best result on Windows. If you don't want to, move /nvim/ to $HOME/.config/ and then hyperlink or whatever to make neovim recognize the init.lua file. </span>
